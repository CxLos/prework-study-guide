# Prework-study-guide

## Description

This study guide was created for the purpose of kick-starting my new career in Tech. As somebody who studied business and has worked in the field for a couple years now, I felt that it was time for me to do a career switch and learn a valuable new skill to add to my expertise. I built this study guide to aid me in the challenging months that lie ahead of me. This field is very foreign to me and i will need as much guidance as possible, so this is where this study guide will come in handy. This study guide will solve any doubts that i may encounter throughout the course. If i need help with something, or just a little refresher, this study guide will assist with that.

I learned various things throughout this prework that will be very useful to me in the future. i learned a lot about the concepts and terminoloy used in this field of work and the thought process of a developer. I learned how to create a GitHub account and familiarize myself with the website, and how to connect to a local and remote repository. I learned how to create HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and READme files as well as the unique purpose each one serves.
